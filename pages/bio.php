<p>Hi there, welcome to rsosadesign.com I am Raul. I was born in the Dominican Republic,
raised in the United States and currently living in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I am an adventurer always looking for 
the next destination and beauty along the way. I love working and learning new things and find my strength
in graphic design. I particularly enjoy coding. There is nothing better in my opinion than conquering
the challenges a good problem may cause and seeing your work and progress throughout the years.
I welcome you to explore this site and check back every now and then - who knows what changes will come. ;) 
For your information; this site was buit on raw HTML/CSS, PHP and light Javascript/JQuery as well
as a tad bit of the Behance API.
